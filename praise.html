<h1>Praise for <em>Java to Kotlin</em></h1>

<blockquote>
 <p>Nat and Duncan open the book by saying they wish this book had existed when they adopted Kotlin. I completely agree. The book takes their experiences, their trials and errors, and helps you, the reader, to be on the right path. It definitely is a book that should be on anyone's shelf coming to Kotlin from the JVM ecosystem. An enjoyable read, and an even better reference guide!</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>To take familiar good old Java code and see it transform, incrementally, into concise, clear, expressive and easy to maintain Kotlin code is a wonderful way to learn the language. Benefit from the experience McGregor and Pryce have distilled in this book.</p>
