    <meta name="description" content="This book takes a novel approach to introducing Kotlin to Java programmers: showing you how to gradually refactor Java code to idiomatic Kotlin while continuing to evolve its functionality. But converting Java to Kotlin is just the starting point. Kotlin has many features beyond Java. Using worked examples, authors Duncan McGregor and Nat Pryce guide you through honing the converted code to make it simpler, more efficient, more expressive, and easier to change. You'll learn how to take advantage of functional constructs to improve program structure, reliability, and error handling."/>
