    <meta name="description" content="This book shows Java programmers how to gradually refactor their Java code using idiomatic Kotlin, while continuing to evolve the code's functionality. Authors Duncan McGregor and Nat Pryce break down the route from Java to Kotlin into legs like Optional to Nullable, Beans to Values, and Open to Sealed Classes. Each explains a key concept and then shows how to refactor production Java to idiomatic Kotlin, gradually and safely, while maintaining interoperability. By the end of the journey, you'll be confident in writing Kotlin from scratch, converting your existing Java when appropriate, and managing a mixed language codebase as it evolves over time."/>
