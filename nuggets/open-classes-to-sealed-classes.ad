== Open Classes to Sealed Classes

=== A Rule of Thumb

Only use typecasts to cast from the root of a sealed class hierarchy to one of the children in an exhaustive when expression.

Otherwise, don't cast your way out of the static types.

Example of errors that can occur if casting: listOf(1,2,3) returns a the List interface of a mutable list.  If you cast it to MutableList you can mutate a list that code is expecting to be (and typed) as unmodifiable.
