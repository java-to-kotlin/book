== Validation to Parsing

We want to push actions to the edge, and keep calculations in the center, in pure, total functions.

Error handling is a kind of action.

So what do we do with malformed input?

Don't map external format into objects and then validate the correctness of the objects' state.

Instead, check the correctness of the data while you are parsing/mapping.

Objects should never exist in an invalid state.
