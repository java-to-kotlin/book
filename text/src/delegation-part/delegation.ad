== Delegation

Computer programs are complex.
We cope with this complexity by hiding it so that we don't have to understand the full horror of our creation at any one time.

In this part we'll look at some of the ways that Java and Kotlin allow us to abstract away the details.
This is another area in which the grains of the languages diverge, so we'll go on to see how to refactor between techniques.
