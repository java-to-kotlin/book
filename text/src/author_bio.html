  <h1>About the Authors</h1>

  <p>
    Between them, Nat and Duncan have over five decades of professional experience in software development.
    They've written a lot of software in a lot of different industries.
    They've also written a lot about writing software,
    written software to help them write about writing software,
    given talks about writing software,
    run workshops about writing software at conferences,
    and helped organise conferences about writing software.
  </p>
  <p>
    A lot of the software they wrote they wrote in Java.
    Not all, but a lot.
    They are old enough to remember when Java was a breath of fresh air compared to C++.
    And now they find Kotlin to be a breath of fresh air compared to Java.
  </p>
  <p>
    So theyâ€™ve written a book about writing software with Kotlin
    (and wrote some software to help them write it).
