== Explaining Variables to Extension Functions

Refactor code from using variables to explain intermediate results in collection processing, to using extension functions to abstract sequences of steps of a collection pipeline.

This abstracts the _middle_ of a transformation pipeline, and makes it seamlessly meld in with the existing transformations API. This is something that cannot be done in Java with the Streams API does not, but Kotlin makes trivial, thanks to extension functions.

TODO: Something about a general principle: factor out the middle of pipelines into useful transformations, rather than the downstream ends as you would do with tell-don't-ask OO design.
