  <h1>Colophon</h1>

  <p>The animal on the cover of <em>Java to Kotlin</em> is a Hausa genet (<em>Genetta thierryi</em>), also known as Thierry's genet. Genets are small, cat-like creatures found in the forests, savannahs, and shrublands ranging from The Gambia to Cameroon. Their speed and agility make them difficult to observe in nature, but Hausa genets have been spotted in the rainforests of Sierra Leone, Ghana, and C&#xf4;te d'Ivoire, the steppes of Senegal, and the woodlands of Guinea-Bissau.</p>
  
  <p>Hausa genets are typically light brown in color with rusty to black spots on the body and stripes down the back. Large triangular ears and round eyes protrude from their long, angular face. Their tails are as long as the body and banded with dark rings. The different species of genet all have similar markings, and can grow from 13–33 inches and weigh anywhere from 4–40 pounds. Hausa genets are on the smaller end of this range in both size and weight. Because they have been so hard to study, we don't know much about their behavior or diet. Other species of genet are nocturnal and spend their days sleeping in burrows or hollow trees. By night, these opportunistic omnivores hunt for small mammals and reptiles, or forage for eggs, fruit, insects, and roots.</p>

  <p>Hausa genets are rare, but they are classified as a species of "Least Concern" by the IUCN due to the variety of habitats and relatively wide range they occupy in West Africa. However, they have been trafficked for their skin or as pets in the past, and have been hunted as bushmeat. Many of the animals on O'Reilly covers are endangered; all of them are important to the world.</p>
